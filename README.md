Assumptions - 
1. Alpha2Code will never be changed and hence configured it as external key and made upsert DML on that.

Repo
1. Only associated code is need to upload not the whole folder structure from VSS.

Other Config/Components
1. Used named credentials instead of configuring remote site setting and placing the key in class or reading from other configs.
